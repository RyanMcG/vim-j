# vim-j

Runtime files for the [*j* programming language](http://www.jsoftware.com/).

>  J is a modern, high-level, general-purpose, high-performance programming
>  language. J is portable and runs on Windows, Unix, Mac, and PocketPC
>  handhelds, both as a GUI and in a console. True 64-bit J systems are
>  available for XP64 or Linux64, on AMD64 or Intel EM64T platforms. J systems
>  can be installed and distributed for free.

The actual files were taken from the
[jwiki](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Guides/Syntax%20Coloring).

The syntax file itself is written and maintained by Bill Lam
&lt;[bbill.lam@gmail.com](mailto:bbill.lam@gmail.com)&gt;. All credit goes to
him. I just wanted this packaged nicely for use with
[vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).
